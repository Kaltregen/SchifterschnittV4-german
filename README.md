# Schifterschnitt V4

This is a windows program for joiners to calculate compund miters with a german GUI. I'm still a beginner in programming and the program needs some cleanup and a security check so it's safe for people to use. All the functionality i tested works fine and the results of the calculation are correct.

The program is written as a WPF-App in Visual Studio in C# and XAML. The idea behind it is to make calculating compound miters easy, even if they are more complex, like when the tilt angle of one board is negative, or when the boards have different thicknesses.
