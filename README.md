# Schifterschnitt V4

### This is a finished german program for joiners to calculate compund miters. The comments in code and the GUI are both in german. At the time i was developing it, i wasn't planning on making the source code public and put it on GitHub.

The program is written as a WPF-App in Visual Studio in C# and XAML. The idea behind it is to make calculating compound miters easy, even if they are more complex, like when the tilt angle of one board is negative, or when the boards have different thicknesses.
