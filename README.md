# Schifterschnitt V4

### This is a finished german program for joiners to calculate compund miters. The comments in code and the GUI are both in german. At the time i was developing it, i wasn't planning on making the source code public and put it on GitHub.

The program is written as a WPF-App in Visual Studio in C# and XAML. The idea behind it is to make calculating compound miters easy, even if they are more complex, like when the tilt angle of one board is negative, or when the boards have different thicknesses.

My Plan is to be porting the program to Java/JavaFX/FXML, so it runs on MacOS and Linux as well. In addition to that i want to make the GUI in different languages, selectable by little flags of the countries, and integrate my first windows program - a simpler version of this one - into the Java version in a fourth tab. For the development i will make another repository. I'm still thinking about a name for the new program. My idea would be "JointersCMO", where "CMO" stands for "compound miter object", because you can also calculate pyramids with the program.
